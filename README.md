# Car-Inventory-Manager

This project’s purpose is to organize a dealership’s car inventory by price in a red-black tree, with added functionality to represent the dealership buying a car (adding to inventory) and selling a car (removing from inventory). The user will be able to search for cars based on a specific price, as well as a range of prices. The user will also be able to quickly gather statistics based on the cars they currently have in their inventory. The car objects data will be provided by the DW and a cited dataset.
